Hello World!

Attached our 3 of my projects related to Data Science from my CMSC 320 Intro to Data Science class. Feel free to look through and critique my analysis.

Naturally, as I was using folium for project 4, I have also uploaded an html version of my project s.t. you can observe the underlying maps present there. 

You can find Project 1 here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J3xmHcx2mDfGf1wE62zq6UJR0SKMxJsE?usp=sharing
